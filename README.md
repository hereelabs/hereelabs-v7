## hereelabs v7

hereelabs v7. The start of a new era. When I think of eras, I think of ears of corn. Corn is pretty tasty. You can put butter on it, and it goes well with mashed potatoes. Speaking of potatoes, I never knew that a potato caused the irish potato famine. Did you know that? I didn't! But you learn more everyday. That is why books are so important. You know, this game has books. There even is a Librarian role! Would you look at that, a role... that serves no purpose! Well, it kinda does, but not entirely. The librarian role is more of a... how do I put it... special role. Only few people can understand it. That reminds me of all the other roles that seemingly have no purpose, like Musician or... well, Musician. I mean, the Clown is important because of its history, and the Mime is ALWAYS getting up to some CRAZY antics... like the clown,  but quieter.

## space station 14 stuff

This is a fork of Mira Station. They did all the work, I'm just slapping stuff on top of it and calling it a day. Give them all the love you can muster.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Space Station 14. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

## Documentation/Wiki

Our [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on SS14s content, engine, game design and more. We also have lots of resources for new contributors to the project.
