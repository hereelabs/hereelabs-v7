## hereelabs v7

hereelabs v7. The start of a new era. When I think of eras, I think of ears of corn. Corn is pretty tasty. You can put butter on it, and it goes well with mashed potatoes. Speaking of potatoes, I never knew that a potato caused the irish potato famine. Did you know that? I didn't! But you learn more everyday. That is why books are so important. You know, this game has books. There even is a Librarian role! Would you look at that, a role... that serves no purpose! Well, it kinda does, but not entirely. The librarian role is more of a... how do I put it... special role. Only few people can understand it. That reminds me of all the other roles that seemingly have no purpose, like Musician or... well, Musician. I mean, the Clown is important because of its history, and the Mime is ALWAYS getting up to some CRAZY antics... like the clown,  but quieter. Why is the clown even on a space station like this? for morale? honestly, i think its a good idea. Going back to the original topic, we are in the beginning of a new era. Things are-a changing, such as my hair! I am growing hair like most people, it's on my head. Do you know how to spell rhombus? Rhombus? Rhombi? Sounds like some kind of shape religious figure. Speak to the Rhombi before talking to me! Get his blessing! AAaaanywho, this is the fork of a game server. What was that? Oh, sorry, I mean, a fork of a game CODE thingy-ma-jig. They code stuff a lot these days! I wish I could write like a maniac, but alas, I am but a worm in this giant, dense, murky forest, of smart people. I think worms are cool, regardless. Oh hey, the bell is ringing! Ring ring! You hear that, buddy? That's right, there's more to see, so much to... I think I got mixed up. Did you hear the bells, though? You didn't? What a shame! They sounded suooo cool and amazing. I wish I had a bell, one that really sounded special, one that sounded like... JINGLE BELL! Haha! Christmas! Well, it isn't christmas but... I was getting off track, wasn't I? Sorry! This is the start of a new era. I've never done an era like this before. Era this, era that, era tional! We should be ALL SERIOUS and NO PLAY! Complete serious-ity. Complete... TOTAL... SERIOUS... DOMINION!!!! Dominion? Domination? Dominiation! Like totally owning some dudes who can't play a game! Unfortunately, I'm no game player. Very bad at them, actually. But that's why we're in the NEW ERA! This is the time for YOU, I mean YOU! To be awesome. Was that not grammatically correct? OOPS! Ya got me there. Hands up, freeze, keep em up and turn around! I'm the police of grammar, and you're going away for a loooooooong time! What was I on about again? Oh, right, This is the START of a NEW ERA. Where I, me, and me alone, alongside everyone else, will make... uh...

## space station 14 stuff

This is a fork of [Mira Station](https://github.com/Mira-Sector/space-station-14). They did all the work, I'm just slapping stuff on top of it and calling it a day. Give them all the love you can muster.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Space Station 14. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

## Documentation/Wiki

Our [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on SS14s content, engine, game design and more. We also have lots of resources for new contributors to the project.
